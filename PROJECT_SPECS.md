# NEXUS AI - Product Requirements Document (Hybrid Edition)

## 1. Product Vision
Nexus AI is a Growth Operating System that combines Inbound Marketing (Social/Content) and Outbound Sales (Lead Gen/Cold Outreach).
It acts as a proactive "Co-pilot": n8n does the heavy lifting (scraping, drafting), the User acts as the Manager (approving).

## 2. Core Modules

### A. The Brain (Strategy & Context)
- **Brand Identity:** Stores Tone of Voice, Mission, Forbidden Words.
- **Vector Store:** RAG system where users upload PDFs (Brochures, Cases). The AI uses this to write context-aware content.
- **Strategy Documents:** Structured JSON storage for SWOT Analysis, Buyer Personas, and Customer Journey Maps (generated by AI during onboarding).

### B. The Hunter (Lead Generation)
- **Search:** User requests "Marketing Agencies in Milan". n8n triggers external scrapers.
- **Enrichment:** System finds emails, phones, and LinkedIn profiles.
- **Table View:** Users can view, filter, and select leads to target.

### C. The Feed (The Unified Command Center)
- A proactive stream of "Proposals".
- **Types of Cards:**
    1.  **Social Proposal:** "News about AI released. Post this on LinkedIn?"
    2.  **Outreach Proposal:** "Found 5 new leads matching your criteria. Send intro emails?"
    3.  **Strategy Proposal:** "Competitor X changed pricing. Update SWOT?"
- **Action:** User clicks [Approve] -> System triggers n8n execution -> Updates UI to [Published].

### D. Integrations Hub
- OAuth Management for Socials (LinkedIn, Meta).
- Connection settings for Email Providers (Gmail/Outlook) and CRMs.

## 3. User Journey
